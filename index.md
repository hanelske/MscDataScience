# Introduction

This website is hosted using the [GitHub Pages system](https://pages.github.com) with the [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) theme.

It is written using the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which is a simple way of writing structured documents without much of the complexity of HTML.

I can use it to

* Write unordered Lists
* For Example

or 

1.  Ordered lists
1.  with numbers
    1.  and subsections

Or I can format some example code:


```c
    int main() 
      {
      printf("Hello World");
      }
```

These links give a basic introduction to using [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and the [GitHub Work Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

Usually, instead of editing on the GitHub website,  you would pull the repo to your desktop pc, edit/test your changes, then commit 
them back to a branch.  You can either do this with the [command line git tools](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html) or various development Environmenmts (e.g. RStudio) can have github support built in.  They are ususally based on top of [GitForWindows](https://gitforwindows.org).
